   - Planetary Radius: `1.12` Earth radii
   - Stellar Temperature: `5778` K (like our Sun)
   - SNR: `18.5`
   - Transit Depth: `0.0034`

3. **Click Classify**
   - "And... **Confirmed Exoplanet** with 89% confidence!"

4. **Highlight visualizations**
   - "The system shows us why: high signal-to-noise ratio and clear transit depth are the key indicators"
   - Point to the pie chart and feature importance chart

### Demo Part 2: Batch Analysis (45 seconds)

2. **Download sample CSV**
   - "Here's a sample CSV format ‚Äì just 6 columns of observational data"

3. **Upload the sample**
   - "Watch as we analyze 8 observations simultaneously..."
   - Wait for processing animation (1-2 seconds)

4. **Show results**
   - "Look at this: 3 confirmed exoplanets, 3 candidates needing more study, and 2 false positives"
   - "The scatter plot shows the relationship between orbital period and planetary radius"
   - "And we can export all of this to CSV for further analysis"

### Demo Part 3: Model Stats (30 seconds)

1. **Switch to Model Stats tab**
   - "Our ML model is trained on NASA's Kepler, K2, and TESS data"
   - "92% accuracy, 90% precision"
   - Show the radar chart
   - "The system has already processed over 1,200 predictions"

### Closing (15 seconds)
"Whether you're analyzing one observation or thousands, **A World Away** makes exoplanet classification fast, accurate, and accessible. It's production-ready, fully responsive, and available for astronomers and researchers right now."
